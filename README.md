# Tableau-Python Temperature Forecast
 
The objective for this project is to build a prediction model that can be used to predict next day's maximum and minimum temperature. Influencing factors are determined by observing how the data is distributed when plotted in a graph.

List of identified factors:
- Minimum Temperature of the Present Day
- Maximum Temperature of the Present Day
- Solar Radiation of the Present Day

A few other variables that remain constant for each stations such as Elevation, Slope, Latitude and Longitude are also included for better accuracy.
